# summa-bokeh
The goal of this project is to investigate the effects from different albedo model schemes, and snow water drainage parameters, on SUMMA model output.
Interactive visualization of model output with the bokeh python library
***

Albedo model schemes (from Homework 1E):
* variable decay
* constant decay
* 

Snow water drainage parameters (from Homework 1F):
* default drainage parameters: 
 * Fcapil = 0.06
 * k_snow = 0.015
 * mw_exp = 3.0
* Fcapil = 0.02
* k_snow = 0.03
* mw_exp = 1.0
* all changes combined
